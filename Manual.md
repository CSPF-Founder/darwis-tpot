## ImportantDetails Folder

Once the setup is complete, a folder named `IMPORTANTDETAILS` is created within the project folder.

This folder contains two files: 
- `IMPORTANTCREDENTIALSANDURLDETAILS.txt`, which includes the Kibana URL and its username, password, and Threat Intel dashboard details.
- `tpotip.txt`, which contains the IP address of the VM.

## Accessing the Threat Intel Dashboard

The Honeypot is integrated with the Threat Intel API Service. Samples received in the honeypot are analyzed using the Threat Intel Service to categorize the verdicts. To enable this service, a license key is required.

You can obtain a free Threat Intel license key from the CySecurity page.

> **Note: The free license key will have a limit of 1000 hash checks and 100 file uploads per day.**

### Obtain Free License Key

- Open your web browser and enter the following address: <https://cysecurity.co/panel/keys/request>.

- This will take you to the license request page, where you can provide your email address to receive an activation link.

### Honeypot Panel

The Honeypot analyzes incidents with our threat intel and categorizes each incident into the following types:

- Whitelist: Trusted and safe samples.
- Safe/Clean: The sample is found to be safe at the moment.
- Malicious: Known threat samples.
- New Malware: Represents threats that have not been previously identified but are detected now.
